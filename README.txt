Hello everyone.

So in case you haven't used Git before, this is our team repository. You can do lots of handy things with Git that make working in a team better. Here's some basic information for our Git.

Data:
The current datasets are located in the data folder. We need to be find some more retinal images so if you find any available datasets you can add them in this folder.

Diabetic Samples:
26_training: background diabetic retinopathy, pigmentary epithelial atrophy, atrophy around optic disk
32_training: background diabetic retinopathy
03_test: background diabetic retinopathy
14_test: background diabetic retinopathy
17_test: background diabetic retinopathy

src:
So standard practice is to have your various code files stored in the src (stands for source) folder.

Branches:
So for now we're working in two teams. So I have made two function branches: "Segmentation" and "Feature Extraction". So make sure to only work in the branches of your team and then we can merge the branches into the main repository when needed. This helps reduce chances of corruption and errors.

Let me know if you have any questions on Git. I'd recommend you use the desktop app, it makes things a lot easier than having to run everything in the command console.
